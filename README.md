## Description of the Project

## User Stories

## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.
I open IntelliJ and start a new Java project, then I name the project, right-click the src folder, and create a new Java class. I paste my code into that file. If I’m using a CSV file like transactions.csv, I make sure it’s in the project folder or fix the path in the code. After that, I just hit the green play button or right-click the file and run it—the app shows up in the terminal at the bottom.
